# Goblin-Shooter

This is a side-scrolling platformer shooting game I made using Pygame. The player character is controlled using the keyboard. Goblins are randomly moving on the screen. The player needs to shoot the goblins to eliminate them. Contact with the goblins will damage the player. There are three game modes with different objectives.
